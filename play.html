<br>MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!
</br>
<br>LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</br>
<br>LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</br>
<br>MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.</br>
<br>LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!</br>
<br>MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</br>
<br>LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?</br>
<br>MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</br>
<br>LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
power and use it.
