<p class = "speech"> What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little!</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY STUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD</h6> <p class = "speech">Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p><br/>


<h6 class = "LADY CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> <p class = "speech">You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p><br/>

<p class = "speech">The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</p><br/>


<h6 class = "LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6> <p class = "speech">Worn to shadows, dear?</p><br/>


<h6 class = "MRS. ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h6> <p class = "speech">Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p><br/>


<h6 class = "LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY STUTFIELD</h6> <p class = "speech">It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their power and use it.</p><br/>
