<br><h6>MRS. ALLONBY</h6>What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!
</br>
<p>
<br><h6>LADY STUTFIELD</h6>Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>LADY CAROLINE</h6>You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>MRS. ALLONBY</h6>Persecute us?  I wish they did.</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>My dear!</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>MRS. ALLONBY</h6>The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>Worn to shadows, dear?</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>MRS. ALLONBY</h6>Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</br>
</p>
<p>
<br><h6>LADY STUTFIELD</h6>It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
power and use it.
