<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>
 <p class = "stage-direction">[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]</p>
<p class = "speech"> What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little!</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY_STUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD</h6> 
<p class = "speech">Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p><br/>


<h6 class = "LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> 
<p class = "speech">You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p><br/>


<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h6> 
<p class = "speech">Persecute us?  I wish they did.</p><br/>


<h6 class =  "LADY_HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6> 
<p class = "speech">My dear!</p><br/>


<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h6>
 <p class = "stage-direction">[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>
<p class = "speech">The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.</p><br/>


<h6 class = "LADY_HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6> 
<p class = "speech">Worn to shadows, dear?</p><br/>


<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h6> 
<p class = "speech">Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p><br/>


<h6 class = "LADY_HUNSTANTON">LADY STUTFIELD</h6> 
<p class = "speech">It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless. They know their power and use it.</p><br/>

<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6>
<p class = "speech">But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6>
<p calss = "speech">Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.</p><br/>

<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]</p>
<p class = "speech">Really?  And if they’re not married?</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6>
<p class = "speech">If they are not married, they should be looking after a
    wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
    about society.</p><br/>

 <h6 class = "LADY_STUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD</h6>
 <p class = "stage-direction">[_Refuses coffee_.]</p>
 <p class = "speech">But if they’re in love with some
    one who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p><br/> 

 <h6 class = "LADY_CAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6>
 <p class = "speech">In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
    in a week to some plain respectable girl.</p><br/>

 <h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6>
 <p class = "speech">I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
    people’s property.</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY_STUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD</h6>
<p class = "speech">Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY_HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>
<p class = "speech">But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
    legislation would improve matters in any way?</p><br/>

<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6>
<p class = "speech">I certainly never know one from the other.</p><br/>

<h6 class = "LADY_STUTFIELD">LADY STUTFIELD</h6>
<p class = "speech">Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man
    has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad
    expression in the eyes of so many married men.</p><br/>

<h6 class = "ALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h6>
<p class = "speech">Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
    tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
    are not.</p><br/>
