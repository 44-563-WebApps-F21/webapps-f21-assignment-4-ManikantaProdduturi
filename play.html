    <h3>A Woman of No Importance</h3>
    <h5>ACT I.  _The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase_.</h5>
    <p>
<br>LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</br>
<br>HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.</br>
<br>LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</br>
<br>HESTER.  We have not many.</br>
<br>LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?</br>
<br>HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
big as France and England put together.</br>
<br>LADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</br>
<br>SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</br>
<br>LADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</br>
